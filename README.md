# Pomodoro Timer Desktop App

## Project Overview

This project is a **Pomodoro Timer** desktop application built using **Tkinter**, the standard Python interface for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that helps improve productivity by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The application provides an easy-to-use interface for tracking work sessions and breaks, making it a helpful tool for users looking to boost focus and manage time effectively.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used to develop the app.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.

## Features

- **Work Sessions**: Set to the traditional 25-minute duration (customizable in the code).
- **Short Breaks**: Automatically start a 5-minute break after each work session.
- **Long Breaks**: A 20-minute break after completing four work sessions.
- **Session Tracking**: Visual indicators to track how many work sessions have been completed.
- **Reset Button**: Easily reset the timer to start over.

## Installation Guide

1. Install the required dependencies (Tkinter is usually included with Python):
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works

- The app follows the **Pomodoro technique** by default, where each cycle consists of:
  - **25 minutes of work**.
  - **5-minute short break**.
  - After every 4 work sessions, a **20-minute long break** occurs.
  
- The user can start the timer by clicking "Start," and the app will automatically switch between work and break sessions.
- The number of completed Pomodoros is tracked and displayed with checkmarks.
- The "Reset" button stops the current session and resets the timer to its default state.

## Future Enhancements

Some possible improvements for future versions of this app include:

- **Customizable Time Settings**: Allow users to set their own work and break durations.
- **Notifications**: Send desktop notifications when a work session or break ends.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Track the number of Pomodoros completed over time, allowing users to review their productivity.
- **Dark Mode**: Add a dark mode theme for better usability in different environments.

## Conclusion

This **Pomodoro Timer App** is a helpful tool for managing productivity and improving focus using the Pomodoro technique. The simple interface makes it easy for anyone to get started, and future enhancements could make it an even more powerful tool.
